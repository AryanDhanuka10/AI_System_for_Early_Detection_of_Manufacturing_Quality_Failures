# Manufacturing Quality AI System

## Problem
Manufacturing defects are often detected too late, causing high rework and scrap costs.

## Solution
A multimodal AI system that predicts quality failures early using:
- Image-based defect detection
- Sensor time-series anomaly detection
- Uncertainty-aware inference
- Explainable AI (Grad-CAM + SHAP)

## Tech Stack
PyTorch, FastAPI, DVC, ONNX, EvidentlyAI

## Deployment
- Frontend: Vercel
- Backend: Hugging Face Spaces
