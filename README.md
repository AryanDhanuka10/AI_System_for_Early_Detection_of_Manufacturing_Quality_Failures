## 📌 Problem Statement

In modern manufacturing environments (automotive, electronics, FMCG, semiconductor):

- Quality defects are often detected **too late**, typically during final inspection
- By that stage, materials are already consumed and rework costs are **5–20× higher**
- Existing systems rely on:
  - Vision-only inspection (misses process drift)
  - Rule-based thresholds (brittle)
  - Manual QA (slow and inconsistent)

### ❌ Core Limitations of Traditional Systems
- No **early warning mechanism**
- No fusion of **images + sensors**
- No uncertainty handling
- No explainability engineers can trust

---

## ✅ Proposed Solution

This project implements a **Hybrid AI Quality Intelligence System** that predicts manufacturing defects **before final inspection** by jointly analyzing:

- 📷 **Product images** (visual defects)
- 📈 **Sensor time-series** (temperature, pressure, vibration)
- 🧠 **Uncertainty-aware decision logic**
- 🧩 **Explainable AI outputs**

The system outputs:
- Defect probability
- Sensor anomaly score
- Final risk score
- Human-in-the-loop (HITL) flag
- Visual and numerical explanations

## 🧠 Why Hybrid AI (Not a Single Model / LLM)?

A single model or LLM **cannot** reliably solve this problem.

| Component | Why It’s Needed |
|--------|----------------|
| CNN (Vision) | Detect micro visual anomalies |
| Sensor Anomaly Model | Capture gradual machine drift |
| Ensemble Fusion | Cross-modal reasoning |
| Uncertainty Logic | Safe decision-making |
| Explainability | Trust for engineers |

> **LLMs are not used as decision makers** — this system prioritizes calibrated, explainable, and reliable predictions.

## 🔬 Models Used

### 1️⃣ Visual Defect Detection
- Custom lightweight **CNN**
- Designed for **edge compatibility**
- Optimized using **ONNX Runtime**

### 2️⃣ Sensor Anomaly Detection
- **Isolation Forest**
- Detects abnormal process behavior
- Robust to unlabeled data

### 3️⃣ Hybrid Risk Fusion
- Gated fusion mechanism
- Sensor anomalies modulate visual confidence
- Produces a calibrated final risk score

---

## 🤖 Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)

When the system is **uncertain**:
- Prediction confidence between 40–60%
- Sample is routed to a **human review queue**
- Enables incremental learning & safer deployment

This reflects **real industrial AI workflows**.

---

## 🔍 Explainable AI (XAI)

### 🖼️ Grad-CAM (Images)
- Highlights **where the model saw the defect**
- Provides visual proof for engineers

### 📊 SHAP (Sensors)
- Shows **which sensor caused the alert**
- Example:
```

Vibration ↑  +0.18
Temperature ↑ +0.07
Pressure ↑ +0.02

```

This turns the system into a **diagnostic tool**, not a black box.

## ⚡ Edge Optimization

Factories often run on limited hardware.

- Model converted to **ONNX**
- Inference run via **ONNX Runtime**
- Latency reduced from ~150ms → ~35ms

| Mode | Latency |
|----|--------|
| PyTorch FP32 | ~150 ms |
| ONNX INT8 | ~35 ms |
